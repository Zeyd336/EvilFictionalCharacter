            <h1>Welcome to the page of the Psychopath villian of FARCRY3</h1>

            <p>Welcome to my page of insanity! Come and explore around my site and enjoy my work just as the people of Rook Islands do. And if you see that <strong>MOTHERF***** JASON</strong>..... you tell me. Me and him have some "business" to discuss.</p>

            <h3>This is one of my many...... what do you call it? "Inspirational" quotes that I think you should take to the heart!</h3>

            <p>Due note that there are three easter eggs hidden through all three webpages. Can you find them all? Who knows, maybe you can help me find Jason so I can put him in my gallery</p>
